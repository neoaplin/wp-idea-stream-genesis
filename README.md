wp-idea-stream-genesis
======================

WP Idea Stream for Genesis WordPress installs.

This plugin is a fork of the excellent WP Idea Stream plugin by imath.

Original Plugin URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-idea-stream/
imath's Vimeo screencast of the original plugin: http://vimeo.com/55241231

I installed imath's plugin, but found that it didn't work with my Genesis install, so made some tweaks. 

From the WP Idea Stream plugin page on WordPress.org:
"WP Idea Stream adds a light Idea Management System to your WordPress Blog. Your members will be able to submit ideas from the front end. A star rating system and 4 widgets to display Ideas related content are included."
